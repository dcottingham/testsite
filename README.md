# testsite
A simple html page for testing

One easy way to create a server that runs this site is the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) npm package.

#bash
```
npm install -g http-server
cd testsite
http-server
open http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Note:  at.js is a separately package and should be included in the `testsite/public` directory.
